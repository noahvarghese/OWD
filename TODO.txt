                - Look at reworking routing to use nicer urls

                        make it look like a directory without file extensions 
                            www.owd.com/blog instead of www.owd.com/index?action=blog

Deploying
- Run sql script to make sure database is set up (Develpment mostly)
- look into transferring ssl certs, and automating creation in dockerfile
- Apache conf (demo and prod)
- Add transfer to dockerfile
- Look into decoupling apache and php, what it would take to connect those 2 servers
    - looks like the php server will still have apache running?
    - looks like maybe the apache only is configured by a load balancer and redirects?
