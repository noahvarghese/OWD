        <h2>Understanding Humidity In Your Home</h2>
        <p>
            Excess humidity can affect your windows, but it is not usually due to your windows. When there is excess moisture
            in your home, you will likely see it on your windows in the form of water droplets, fog, or frost. This occurs when
            there is more humidity in your home than is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your home has excess humidity, it is more likely to occur when it’s cold outside because the warm, humid air
            inside comes into contact with a cold surface — your windows. In many cases, homeowners think that there is
            something wrong with their windows, but this is not always the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your home is showing more condensation on the top floor of your home and you can see dark edges on carpeting,
            you likely have an insulation issue.

        <h2>The Effects Of Excess Humidity</h2>
        <p>
            Although windows tend to be the first place you see condensation, it doesn’t mean it’s not affecting other areas of
            your home as well. Excess moisture can lead to mould growth and aggravate allergies and asthma if it’s not kept
            under control. Constant moisture on your windows can cause water damage, and if the panes are made of wood, this
            can also lead to swelling and wood rot.

        <h2>How To Reduce Humidity In Your Home</h2>
        <p>
            There are several things you can do if you notice that your home may have too much humidity:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install a ceiling fan in your bathroom to help remove steam from your shower or bath.</li>
            <li>Install a vapour barrier on any unfinished parts of your home and behind walls, if possible.</li>
            <li>Use a dehumidifier.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>The Truth About Humidity And Your Windows</h2>
        <p>
            Condensation on your new windows can actually indicate strong insulation. Older windows may have been allowing
            moisture to escape from your house, whereas a new and more efficient set of windows will prevent this from
            happening, keeping your home comfortable and heating costs down.
