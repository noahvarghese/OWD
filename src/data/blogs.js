Even if you don’t detect rot in the other parts of your window frames, pay close attention to the window sill. Check for signs of paint wear and any soft areas.",

                    "The mitre joints are located in the corners of your interior casing trim. Check these corners for a gap. If the gap is larger in the bottom corners than the top corners, this is a clear indication that the wood was compromised by water in the fall and froze during the winter months, as the water expands and blows the corners apart. Leaving this unfixed for an extended period of time could result in drywall damage, followed by potential mould and electrical issues.",

        description: "For many homeowners in Oakville and beyond, one of the most important parts about owning a home is keeping the temperature consistent. We like to have our homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter.That’s why it’s important to understand how balloons work. The theory behind balloons states that objects with high density, like a helium balloon or a hot air balloon, will always rise. Hot air balloons rise because hot air has a higher density than cool air.",

Improper fittings on your windows and doors will lead to a more dramatic difference.",
