      While you should always consult your window manufacturer’s cleaning
      instructions, there are a few general tips for window cleaning that are
      safe for all kinds of windows.

      <ol>

      <li><strong>Start with clean water and no soap.</strong> Using a soft cloth, gently rub the water over the glass, then wipe clean with a damp cloth. If your windows aren’t clean enough after this, add a very small amount of a mild detergent or dish soap to the water and repeat.</li>

      <li>For large windows, <strong>use a squeegee to remove the water</strong> from the surface of the glass.</li>

      <li><strong>Clean the window screens with a vacuum and a soft brush attachment.</strong> For dirtier screens, remove them and gently rinse them with a hose.</li>

      <li>If vinyl frames or window tracks need to be cleaned, use the same mild cleanser and water mixture.</li>

      Just as important as knowing how to clean your windows, is how not to
      clean your windows. Avoid these common mistakes so you don’t damage your
      new windows:

      <ol>

      <li><strong>Never use a power washer or high pressure spray.</strong> These can damage the window seals, and your windows may not be airtight or as watertight as before.</li>

      <li><strong>Keep strong detergents and solvents away from your windows.

      </strong> These types of cleaners can weaken the protective coating on the glass and can even cause damage to the vinyl, wood or fibreglass portions of the windows.</li>

      <li><strong>Avoid using WD-40 or oil-based lubricants.</strong> These can attract dirt and make your windows dirtier and more difficult to clean.</li>

      <li><strong>Avoid using sharp tools around your windows.</strong> Sharp tools can damage the seal on your windows and can lead to decreased efficiency and increased moisture in your home.</li>

      </ol>
