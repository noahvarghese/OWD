description: When purchasing a brand-new front entry door, don’t overlook the
  small and usually forgotten detail of your doorbell button. A nice new button
  can add so much to the look and feel of your home’s curb appeal. After
  investing a sizable chunk of change into your new front door, the last thing
  you want to do is reuse your cracked, broken, weathered, old doorbell button –
  which would not help your beautiful new front door to shine. The cost of a new
  doorbell button may set you back only about $20.00, but this small investment
  is well worth it.
