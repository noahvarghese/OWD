      That’s why all of our vinyl windows have a multi-point locking system.
      This system is the highest quality and most secure option available to
      homeowners.

  - content: Our doors are commercially-rated, and are four times stronger than
      typical residential door frames. Like our windows, our doors also come
      with a multi-point locking system to keep your home safe.

      <ul>

      <li>If your windows or doors don’t have multi-point locking systems, consider having one or two extra locks installed or have your windows and doors replaced</li>

      <li>Make sure the hinges on your doors are not exposed to the exterior of the house, and are equipped with non-removable hinge pins; exposed hinges are easily removed</li>

      <li>Consider installing exterior doors without windows; these can be a security risk, especially if the window is within arm’s reach of your lock</li>

      <li>Don’t plant shrubs right next to your door as these can be a good hiding place for burglars who might wait until the house is empty</li>

      <li>Make sure your doorframes and window frames are sturdy and do not have any damage; a weak frame is an easy target for burglars</li>

      <li>Keep glass doors locks and make sure they’re made of reinforced glass or plastic</li>

      </ul>
