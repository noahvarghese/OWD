description: Humidity is excess moisture circulating in your home. If your home
  has too much humidity, the first place that you             will notice this
  will likely be on your windows — but this doesn’t mean that your windows are
  the problem. If you’ve             ever asked the question, “Does Humidity
  Affect Windows?” read on for the answer and some helpful solutions.

      Excess humidity can affect your windows, but it is not usually due to your
      windows. When there is excess moisture in your home, you will likely see
      it on your windows in the form of water droplets, fog, or frost. This
      occurs when there is more humidity in your home than is necessary.\n


      If your home has excess humidity, it is more likely to occur when it’s cold outside because the warm, humid air inside comes into contact with a cold surface — your windows. In many cases, homeowners think that there is something wrong with their windows, but this is not always the case.\n


      If your home is showing more condensation on the top floor of your home and you can see dark edges on carpeting, you likely have an insulation issue.

    content: Although windows tend to be the first place you see condensation, it
      doesn’t mean it’s not affecting other areas of your home as well. Excess
      moisture can lead to mould growth and aggravate allergies and asthma if
      it’s not kept under control. Constant moisture on your windows can cause
      water damage, and if the panes are made of wood, this can also lead to
      swelling and wood rot.

      There are several things you can do if you notice that your home may have
      too much humidity:


      * Install a ceiling fan in your bathroom to help remove steam from your shower or bath.

      * Install a vapour barrier on any unfinished parts of your home and behind walls, if possible.

      * Use a dehumidifier.

      Condensation on your new windows can actually indicate strong insulation.
      Older windows may have been allowing moisture to escape from your house,
      whereas a new and more efficient set of windows will prevent this from
      happening, keeping your home comfortable and heating costs down.\n
