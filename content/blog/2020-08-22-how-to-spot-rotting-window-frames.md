title: How To Spot Rotting Window Frames
date: 2016-07-28T17:07:00.000Z
description: If you’re a homeowner, you know that your home has ways of telling
  you when it needs repairs. Some home damage can be really obvious, like a
  broken window or a major water leak. But some home damage can be a little
  harder to identify unless you go looking for it, like rotten wood.\nRotten
  wood is especially dangerous because even if it starts at a specific point in
  your house, it can quickly and easily spread throughout, wherever there is
  wood. And the most likely place to find rotten wood is your window frames, as
  they are exposed to the elements on a daily basis. Here’s how to tell if your
  window frames are rotten.

section:
  - heading: 1. You Can See The Rot
    content: Your first sign for identifying rotting window frames is by looking at
      them. If you can see that the wood is rotting, you should have the frames
      replaced.
  - heading: 2. It Feels Soft To The Touch
    content: If you suspect your window frames are rotten, go around to each of your
      windows and test them by how they feel when you touch them. We all know
      that wood should be hard and sturdy to the touch. Check your window frames
      for any softness, brittleness or crumbliness. If your window frames are
      very rotten, they might even disintegrate when you touch them.
  - heading: 3. Discolouration
    content: >+
      Rotten window frames often lead to other problems, like fungi and mould.
      If you see any changes in the colour of your window frame, it’s likely a
      sign that it’s rotting. Also check for peeling paint, either directly on
      the window frame or surrounding it, as you may have a water leak.

  - heading: 4. Check The Window Sill First
    content: >+
      Your window sill is the first place the window frame will rot, because
      water will often sit on the window sill longer than any other part of the
      window frame. Even if you don’t detect rot in the other parts of your
      window frames, pay close attention to the window sill. Check for signs of
      paint wear and any soft areas.

  - heading: 5. Check The Mitre Joints
    content: >+
      The mitre joints are located in the corners of your interior casing trim.
      Check these corners for a gap. If the gap is larger in the bottom corners
      than the top corners, this is a clear indication that the wood was
      compromised by water in the fall and froze during the winter months, as
      the water expands and blows the corners apart. Leaving this unfixed for an
      extended period of time could result in drywall damage, followed by
      potential mould and electrical issues.

  - heading: 6. Prevent Your Window Frames From Rotting
    content: >
      After you’ve inspected all of your window frames, and had them replaced if
      necessary, the final step is to prevent rot from occurring again. First,
      make sure your gutters are properly maintained and guiding rain water away
      from your house. If you’re replacing your windows and rot is a concern,
      try installing vinyl or vinyl clad windows instead of wood. If you decide
      to stick to wood window frames, make sure you seal them with a good
      outdoor paint as a barrier. Keep your home well-ventilated to prevent
      moisture and condensation from building up and causing the frames to rot
      from the inside as well.
