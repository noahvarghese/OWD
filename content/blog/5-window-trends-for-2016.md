      <p>One of the biggest trends for 2016 in windows is vinyl, and there are
      lots of reasons why. Homeowners are choosing to replace their old wood
      windows with vinyl because of their energy efficiency. Vinyl is also a
      more cost-effective option than wood, with wood requiring a lot of
      maintenance to prevent rotting and warping. Vinyl windows come in a wide
      range of styles, colours and finishes, so they’ll look great no matter the
      style of your home.</p>

      <p>As more and more homeowners are looking for ways to brighten up their
      space, large casement windows are a popular choice for 2016. More natural
      light means spending less money on electric bills, but having a large
      window also means easily incorporating nature into your home. Installing a
      casement window in the master bedroom or living room is a great statement
      piece.</p>

      <p>Double-hung windows have been popular for years, and they don’t show
      any signs of going anywhere anytime soon. Double-hung windows have two
      sashes that slide up and down, and offer a pleasing, traditional look that
      a lot of homeowners love. They also offer excellent ventilation for your
      home.</p>

  - heading: Bay Windows
    content: <p>Bay windows are one of the most sought-after window types for
      homeowners. They have a sort of whimsical connotation, and look great in
      almost any style of home. Bay windows not only let in a ton of light to
      your space, but they also add a beautiful architectural element to both
      the exterior and interior of your home.</p>
