section:
  - heading: 1. Clear The Entrance To Your Home
    content: >+
      <p>It will be essential for your window or door installers to have easy,
      unobstructed access to your home through the front door or another
      entrance. They’ll want to have their vehicle parked in the driveway, or
      directly in front of your home. During the winter months, please ensure
      that these main areas are shovelled and salted prior to the installers’
      arrival. Kindly be sure to move any outdoor furniture and/or other objects
      away from the windows and doors that are being replaced.</p>

  - heading: 2. Remove Blinds And Curtains

      <p>If you’re having your windows replaced, be sure to remove all blinds
      and curtains from the windows before your installers arrive. To replace
      your windows, your technicians will need unobstructed access to your
      window frames.</p>

  - heading: 3. Clear The Floor

      <p>Keeping the floors clear is essential for ensuring your window or door
      installers have room to work safely and efficiently. Remove any toys or
      other small items that may be lying around the floor. In addition,
      consider moving rugs out of the room until the installation is complete;
      it will prevent the rugs from getting damaged and avoid a potential
      tripping hazard for the workers.</p>

  - heading: 4. Contact Your Alarm Company
    content: >+
      <p>Contacting your alarm company prior to the installation of new windows
      and doors will eliminate the possibility of setting off the alarm when
      your existing windows and doors get removed. You may have sensors on some
      of your windows and doors and it is important to remove them prior to
      installation so they do not get disposed of. Sometimes it is required to
      have your alarm company come out to disconnect and reconnect the alarms
      before and after the installation.</p>

  - heading: 5. Secure Children And Pets
    content: >+
      <p>During the process of replacing windows and doors, your home is
      considered a job site and proper safety measures must be taken. Carefully
      watch over your children and, if required, secure pets to a seperate part
      of the home, such as a bedroom or basement.</p>
