title: Choosing The Perfect Colour For Your Steel Door System

  When choosing a paint colour for your new steel entry door system, it is
  recommended to go with one shade darker than what your desired final colour
  choice is. The ultra smooth finish of a steel door reflects a bit more light
  than the usually matte paint chip samples that you use to choose a colour.
  This commonly results in a slightly lighter appearance in the door compared to
  the sample. Even though the colour will be an exact match, the different
  finishes can trick your eyes into thinking theyâ€™re not.
