  For many homeowners in Oakville and beyond, one of the most important parts
  about owning a home is keeping the temperature consistent. We like to have our
  homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\

  That’s why it’s important to understand how balloons work. The theory behind balloons states that objects with high density, like a helium balloon or a hot air balloon, will always rise. Hot air balloons rise because hot air has a higher density than cool air.

      <p>For many homeowners in Oakville and beyond, one of the most important
      parts about owning a home is keeping the temperature consistent. We like
      to have our homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>


      <p>That’s why it’s important to understand how balloons work. The theory behind balloons states that objects with high density, like a helium balloon or a hot air balloon, will always rise. Hot air balloons rise because hot air has a higher density than cool air.</p>


      <p>A similar phenomenon happens inside our homes. Warm air rises in our homes because it is surrounded by cool, lower-density air. It wants to move into a space with lower density.</p>


      <p>All homes leak. In the winter, warm, buoyant air from the inside will leak out of your home through the spaces in the roof. At the same time, cool air will enter the bottom level of your house through the gaps in doors and windows. You will get a hot upstairs and a cool downstairs. Improper fittings on your windows and doors will lead to a more dramatic difference.</p>


      <p>In the summer, the opposite happens, with cool air leaking out and warm air leaking in. This is also how our homes lose air pressure. Any leaks in your roof, windows or doors can lead to a buildup of moisture in your windows, which causes mildew to form.</p>


      <p>Roofs, windows and doors are the main culprits when it comes to heat loss in the winter and cool air loss in the summer. That’s why it is so important to have your roof inspected regularly and have new windows installed if they’re starting to leak excessively. This will be the best way to prevent the growth of mildew in these parts of your home.</p>
