      Excess humidity can affect your windows, but it is not usually due to your
      windows. When there is excess moisture in your home, you will likely see
      it on your windows in the form of water droplets, fog, or frost. This
      occurs when there is more humidity in your home than is necessary.

      If your home is showing more condensation on the top floor of your home

      Although windows tend to be the first place you see condensation, it
      doesn’t mean it’s not affecting other areas of your home as well. Excess
      moisture can lead to mould growth and aggravate allergies and asthma if
      it’s not kept under control. Constant moisture on your windows can cause
      water damage, and if the panes are made of wood, this can also lead to
      swelling and wood rot.
