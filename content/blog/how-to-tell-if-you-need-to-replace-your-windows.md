  It can be difficult to tell when your windows need to be repaired and when
  they need to be replaced. Watch for these signs to determine whether it’s time
  to replace your windows:

      The most noticeable sign that your windows need to be replaced is that
      your home begins to feel drafty and you notice leaks coming from your
      windows. This is especially obvious on a cold, windy day, but you may
      notice it in your heating and cooling bills as well. Purchasing energy
      efficient windows can help to lower your utility bills and make your home
      feel more comfortable.

  - heading: 2. Your Windows Are Old

      Generally, windows that are between 20 and 30 years old should be
      replaced. Windows that are this old may only have a single pane of glass,
      which makes them less energy efficient for your home. Older windows may
      also be lacking in glazing, which helps to keep UV rays out of your home.
      Consider replacing your windows to get the energy efficient benefits of
      double pane glass.

  - heading: 3. Your Windows Won’t Open

      One of the most important features of a window is that it opens! If your
      windows have lost that ability, then it’s time to replace them. Whether
      they have become stuck due to paint or the handles have become locked in
      place, it may be time to replace your windows.

  - heading: 4. You Can Hear Lots Of Outdoor Noise
    content: >+
      Most windows aren’t sound-proof, but if you can hear outside noise
      relatively clearly when your windows are closed, you may want to consider
      new windows. New windows come with a Sound Transmission Class rating
      (STC); the higher the rating, the less noise you’ll hear from outside. If
      you live near a busy street, school, train tracks or even near a noisy
      neighbour, replacing your windows could help you get more peace and quiet
      inside.

  - heading: 5. Your Windows Are Damaged
    content: >+
      Window damage can sometimes be repaired, but extensive damage to your
      windows is a good reason to get replacements. Look for signs like chipping
      or damage to the glass, water stains around the window, warped or broken
      frames or cracked glass. Damaged windows can be ugly to look at and can
      make your home significantly less energy efficient.
