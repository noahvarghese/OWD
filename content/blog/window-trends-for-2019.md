      <p>More and more homeowners are leaning toward a more modern look for
      their homes, and with this comes the trend for black finishes. Black
      finishes, on both the interior and exterior of the windows, adds a
      contemporary look and a bold statement to your home, especially when
      paired with a white trim.</p>

  - heading: 2. Clean Lines & Lots Of Glass
    content: >
      <p>As we move toward more modern and contemporary looks for windows,
      homeowners are opting for windows and doors with clean lines and lots of
      glass. Aluminum and steel-framed windows with defined edges and crisp
      lines will be big next year. As well, with larger windows becoming more
      accessible to buyers, we’re seeing a focus on lots of glass, making it
      easier to combine outdoor and indoor living.</p>

      <p>Energy efficient windows used to be an added bonus, but these days,
      they’re non-negotiable for homeowners. Many people are looking for the
      Energy Star rating on their windows and won’t buy anything less, as they
      seek to make their homes more energy efficient and save a few dollars on
      their utility bills.</p>

      <p>Rounded arches and curved windows are becoming less and less popular.
      While they’re not going away completely, we’re seeing a shift from windows
      with arched tops to a more rectilinear shape as homeowners look for ways
      to bring a more modern look to their homes.</p>

      right windows for your home. <a
