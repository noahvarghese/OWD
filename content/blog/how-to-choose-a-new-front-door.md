  Your <a href="https://oakvillewd.com/doors"><strong>front door</strong></a> is
  a major part of your home, both aesthetically and functionally, so it’s
  important to choose the right one. If you are looking to replace your front
  door, here’s what you should consider:

      When it comes to choosing a front door, there’s nothing quite as important
      as the type of material. If you have an old wood door, you should consider
      replacing it with a new steel or fibreglass door for increased durability
      and energy-efficiency. Steel doors are more affordable and are typically
      painted a solid colour. Fibreglass, on the other hand, is more expensive
      but can mimic the appearance of wood. Both are low-maintenance options
      that are a great choice for any home.

  - heading: 2. Style

      Your front door has a big impact on your home’s curb appeal, so it’s
      important to consider what style you prefer. At Oakville Windows & Doors,
      we encourage our customers to bring in a photo of their home (or we can
      locate it using Google’s street view) so our team can recommend door
      styles that will work with the rest of your home’s facade. Whether your
      home is cottage-style, stucco, tudor, modern or otherwise, choosing a
      front door that fits with your home’s style is essential.

  - heading: 3. Colour
    content: >+
      For some homeowners, the front door is a place to add a pop of colour and
      bring some attention to the front of the home. For others, a door with a
      more muted appearance that blends in with the siding, trim and brickwork
      is more desirable. When it comes to choosing a colour for your door, it is
      all a matter of personal preference.

  - heading: 4. Privacy Vs. Decorative Glass
    content: >+
      Decorative glass can add style and beauty to your front door, whether you
      opt for side lites, a transom window, or a door that provides a central
      glass insert. If you’re considering decorative glass for your front door,
      it’s important to understand that you will be sacrificing some privacy, so
      make sure you are comfortable with that before you purchase a door with
      decorative glass.
