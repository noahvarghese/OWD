  - heading: 1. New Windows Are Made Of High-Quality Materials
    content: >+
      If you have older windows  you will be missing out on the advantages of
      window technology, which has come a long way since your existing windows.
      Today’s windows are made of higher quality materials and are durable,
      low-maintenance and help to reduce heat transfer. New windows have better
      insulation, whether they’re wood, fibreglass, vinyl, aluminum, composite
      or a combination.

  - heading: 2. Two Panes Are Better Than One
    content: >+
      Some older windows, depending on the age, may only have one pane of glass.
      Most newer windows will have two or more panes, with an air- or gas-filled
      space between them. This provides much better insulation than a single
      pane. For even higher energy efficiency, look for Energy Star windows with
      three or more panes!

  - heading: 3. Gas Over Air
    content: >+
      While two panes of glass with an air-filled space between them is always
      better than a single pane, homeowners have the option to make their homes
      even more energy efficient with gas-filled panes. When you choose gas,
      like argon and krypton, you’ll get even better insulation than just air.

  - heading: 4. Better Reflection
    content: >+
      Homeowners now have the option to choose windows that have special
      coatings on the glass, reflecting infrared light. This coating will help
      to keep the heat inside your home during the winter and outside during the
      summer. The coatings will also help to protect your furniture, carpet and
      other items from fading.

  - heading: 5. No More Damage Or Leaks
    content: >+
      Depending on the age of your windows, you may notice damage to the seals,
      frames and other features that could be causing leaks. When the damage
      reaches a point where it can no longer be fixed, replacing your windows is
      the best option for a leak-free, energy-efficient home.
