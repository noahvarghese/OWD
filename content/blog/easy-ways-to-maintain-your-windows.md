  great shape:

      While using your windows may seem self-explanatory, many homeowners don’t
      realize there are right and wrong ways to open windows. Casement windows,
      for example, should never be opened all the way. Fully opening casement
      windows puts pressure on the hinges from the wind and weight of the glass.
      You should only fully open casement windows for cleaning or in the case of
      an emergency; otherwise, keep them open on an angle. For other types of
      windows, avoid slamming them shut or forcing them open to prevent damage.

  - heading: 2. Avoid Using Pressure Washers

      Keeping your windows clean is a great way to keep them in good shape, but
      it’s important to clean them the right way. Many homeowners choose to
      clean their windows with pressure washers, but the pressure of the water
      can actually do more harm than good. Pressure washers can damage the seals
      on your windows, leading to potential rot or water damage. The high
      pressure can also compromise the integrity of double-pane windows, leading
      to fog between the panes of glass.

  - heading: 3. Avoid Harsh Chemicals
    content: >+
      Unless recommended by the window manufacturer, you should never use strong
      chemicals to clean your windows. To clean vinyl and aluminum frames, use a
      mild detergent or soap (or no soap at all) to wipe away dust and dirt. Be
      especially careful with cleaners when it comes to cleaning painted windows
      as it can damage the paint or strip the colour. Avoid using too much water
      when cleaning wood windows, as this can encourage rotting and mould.
