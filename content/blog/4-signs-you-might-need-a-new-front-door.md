  Your front door is the first impression for your home. It’s one of the first
  things that visitors see when they come to your home, and it’s also one of the
  most important parts of your home’s security.<br/>


  Making sure your front door is in great shape is important for keeping your family protected and your home looking its best. Here are some telltale signs that you may need a new front door:

      If your door is exhibiting rust and other wear-and-tear, this is about
      more than just the aesthetics. Visible signs of wear-and-tear on your door
      may indicate that the structural integrity has been compromised. Rust can
      also indicate problems with moisture. If your front door is full of rust
      and dents, it’s a good idea to consider a replacement.

  - heading: Moisture In The Glass

      If your front door has panes of glass in it, moisture in the glass could
      be a sign that you need a new door. Over time, older doors will begin to
      lose the seal on the windows. Moisture can lead to mould and mildew
      between the glass, and this can become a major problem if any part of your
      door is made of wood.

      The doors and windows in our homes should keep the outside elements
      outside, and if your front door is starting to become drafty, you should
      consider replacing it. A drafty door will cost you money on utilities, so
      replacing your front door could save you money in the long run.

  - heading: Your Front Door Is Difficult To Open Or Close

      Opening and closing your front door shouldn’t be a workout. One of the
      most obvious signs that you need a new front door is when your door begins
      to stick, or you notice gaps between the door and the frame when it’s
      closed. Sticking and gaps can be a sign of your door warping, which can
      become a safety issue as well as a comfort issue.
