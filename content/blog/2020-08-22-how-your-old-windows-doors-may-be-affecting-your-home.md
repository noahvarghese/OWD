    content: Curb appeal is important for a number of reasons, from showing off your
      pride in your home to potentially increasing your home’s resale value. But
      if you have old windows and doors, they could be taking away from your
      home’s curb appeal, not adding to it. Old, damaged, or deteriorating
      windows and doors with peeling paint or murky glass could be making your
      home more of an eyesore than you think. Replacing your windows and doors
      will give your home a fresh, new look that you, your neighbours and
      potential buyers will love.
  - heading: 2. Water Issues
    content: Our windows and doors are designed to protect us from the elements, but
      if yours are particularly old, they may be letting the elements in. The
      seals in your older windows and doors may have started to break down,
      allowing water to get through.
  - heading: 3. Drafts
    content: When your old windows and doors begin to lose their seals, in addition
      to moisture, you may also start to notice drafts in your home. Not only do
      drafts make your home less comfortable, but they also lead to higher
      heating and cooling bills throughout the year. New windows and doors are
      much more energy efficient, and can save you hundreds of dollars a year on
      utilities.
  - heading: 4. Fading Furniture
    content: For many of us, faded furniture is just a fact of life. However, your
      aging windows could be why your upholstery and rugs no longer look quite
      as bright as they used to be. New windows offer better UV protection for
      your belongings; look for windows with a low-E coating to ensure the items
      in your home have the best protection from the sun.
  - heading: 5. Safety & Security
    content: One of the most important ways your old windows and doors could be
      impacting your home is safety and security. Old or broken windows and
      doors could make your home more susceptible to break-ins, but new ones
      come with a range of features that can make you and your family safer.
      Multi-locking systems, higher-quality materials and fusion-welded
      components come standard in most new windows and doors, and can help
      improve your home’s security.
