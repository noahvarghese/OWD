  There is no denying that grey is currently one of the hottest trends in
  decorating. It is one of our most popular colours for entry doors and is
  beginning to gain popularity as a window colour as well – and just about
  anything else related to home décor. Here are a few of our favourite Benjamin
  Moore greys:

      <p>These are 4 of our favourite Benjamin Moore greys, however any shade is
      a safe bet right now. Our list could have easily been 20 shades long.
      Kendal Charcoal especially is one that we are seeing being ordered over
      and over again throughout the years. This colour is very popular since it
      leans itself very nicely to both traditional door styles and contemporary
      door styles. It is one of those colours that looks great next to any
      colour of brick or stone. It is very beautiful and complimentary on almost
      any home.</p>

      <p>Another grey colour that we cannot leave out is Iron Ore by Gentek Building Products. Iron Ore has been a top seller for years but recently has really taken off as it has become the standard ‘go-to’ dark grey in the industry. Not only are homeowners ordering it for their new front doors, but windows are also being ordered in this colour. Its popularity continues to grow more and more each season. Without a doubt, Iron Ore is our top selling grey.</p>
