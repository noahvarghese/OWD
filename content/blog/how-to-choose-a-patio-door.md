  Patio doors often go overlooked, but they’re an important part of your home.
  They connect the interior with your outdoor space and allow you to truly enjoy
  your home to its fullest.<br /> br />

  If you’re thinking about installing a new patio door, here are a few important things to consider:

      The first thing to consider when choosing your patio door is the design.
      You’ll want to choose something that fits the style of the rest of your
      home, but you’ll also want to consider things like functionality and
      accessibility.

      Does your space allow for a hinged patio door? If you don’t have room, it
      may be best to consider a sliding patio door. Bi-parting doors, on the
      other hand, are a great option if you prefer a modern look and you really
      want to take advantage of your view.

      Additionally, you’ll want to consider features of the door like grille
      patterns, grilles between the glass and simulated divided lites. And don’t
      forget about colour, which you can choose to coordinate with your home,
      interior design style and more.

      Next, you should consider what your outdoor space is like. Do you have a
      patio or a small balcony? Will the patio door open up onto a deck? Do you
      have a large outdoor space? These questions will help you decide whether
      you want, or have the room for, an outswing door, or if an inswing is
      better suited to your outdoor space.

      More and more homeowners are opting for large, expansive patio doors with
      plenty of unobstructed glass. This allows them to enjoy their outdoor
      space even when the doors are closed, and it’s a great option for
      single-family homes with a stunning view or beautifully landscaped garden.

  - heading: 3. Energy Efficiency & Choosing The Best Materials

      Like windows, patio doors can play a big role in making your home energy
      efficient and keeping your heating and cooling bills low. For the highest
      energy efficiency, consider vinyl and wood patio doors. Vinyl patio doors
      will also give you a low-maintenance option, lots of options for colours
      and a modern look. Wood patio doors require more maintenance but offer a
      classic style and more flexibility for design options. Energy Star
      certifications are a good indicator of energy efficiency, so keep an eye
      out for those ratings when selecting your new windows and doors.
