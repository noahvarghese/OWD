      Windows with grills have become a popular choice for homeowners looking
      for a high-end, luxury look, but grills can have an impact on your home’s
      natural light. Not only do grills have the potential to obstruct your
      view, but they can also limit the amount of light that comes through your
      windows and into your home. Switching out your grilled windows will also
      help increase your home’s energy efficiency, as grills can stop the argon
      gas in the glass from working the way it’s supposed to.

  - heading: 2. Remove Privacy Glass

      For years, homeowners have chosen privacy glass for areas of their homes
      like bathrooms. While privacy glass still allows natural light into your
      home, you won’t get as much as you would with clear glass.

  - heading: 3. Get Brick-To-Brick Installation

      If you’re considering new windows for your home, it’s important to know
      the difference between the two primary types of installation options. Many
      window installers do retrofit installations because they are more
      cost-effective, but this means fitting your new windows to the old frames.
      This often means that the new windows will end up not being as large as
      they could have been. Brick-to-brick installation, on the other hand, will
      allow you to get the most light possible as you’ll get a bigger window
      than a retrofit installation.
