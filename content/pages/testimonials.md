                    Windows & doors installation & service review in Oakville
                    I have to admit that I saw mostly positive reviews on this site for Oakville
                    Windows and Doors and thought that was just the most sasitified customers,
                    but now I realize that every customer feels the same way, including myself. had
                    received other quotes from other competitors, but only Andre truly understood
                    my needs and I felt comfortable working with him. I came to him with a very
                    tight timeline, so tight in fact that some of the competition thought that he was
                    just telling me what I wanted<a class="readMore Testimonials" href="https://homestars.com/companies/2785148-oakville-windows-doors-inc" target="_blank">....READ MORE</a>

                    We had our 20 year old shutters and wooden windows replaced in our entire
                    home last week--our house looks amazing! My contact was Jessica, who came
                    out for an estimate the day after my phone call. I did my research and called a
                    few other companies, but none of them gave me the comfort that Jessica did,
                    and establishing rapport is VERY important to me. There was no pressure--just
                    honest advice, lots of knowledge and a great price. As for the install, I can
                    honestly say that Walter and his crew<a class="readMore Testimonials" href="https://homestars.com/companies/2785148-oakville-windows-doors-inc" target="_blank">....READ MORE</a>

                    We needed a repair for a seven year old BR window that had broken...was
                    installed by another company...with whom we has no confidence because of
                    their real ornery attitude. We had also used Oakville Windows for the bulk of
                    our window replacements, so I called them to have a look at the defective
                    window. They will replaceit within 2 days at a very reasonable cost...even tho it
                    is not one of theirsâ€™. Andre, the owner of oakville inspected the window the
                    same day that I called him...great service<a class="readMore Testimonials" href="https://homestars.com/companies/2785148-oakville-windows-doors-inc" target="_blank">....READ MORE</a>

                    We chose this company over one in Burlington, to get our mom all new
                    windows - because of Jessica and the compassionate way she treated us, and
                    their prices which were way cheaper than the company who gave a discount.
                    Jessica never tried to upsell but rather suggested good quality for the price of
                    the home. The crew cleaned up, and completely rebuilt the front bay window
                    which had so much more rot than they expected. The crew stayed until the job
                    was finished. We were very pleased with the<a class="readMore Testimonials" href="https://homestars.com/companies/2785148-oakville-windows-doors-inc" target="_blank">....READ MORE</a>
