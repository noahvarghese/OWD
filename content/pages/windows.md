                        Vinyl windows are the most common types of windows we install, and
                        they’re a popular choice for homeowners. Vinyl windows are an excellent
                        investment, and will last years. They offer many benefits, including:

                        <li>- Energy efficiency</li>
                        <li>- Resistant to salt air and harsh industrial pollutants</li>
                        <li>- Require virtually no maintenance</li>

                        If you want a timeless and classic look for your home, wood
                        windows are the option for you. They’re a beautiful choice
                        for older homes and add lots of character, while still
                        offering many of the same benefits as vinyl windows.
